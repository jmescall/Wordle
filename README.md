# Wordle
This was created as a fun exploration of different ways to solve Wordle after I started reading a book on Information Theory.

The modules in this repository are not designed to serve as a duplicate of the NYT Wordle where you can play the game yourself, but there is a (very na√Øve) command line recommendation engine for assisting you as you play elsewhere. 

More so, the repo was created to serve the purpose of using Information Theory and intuitive algorithms to minimize the number of guesses across (all) possible Wordle games. Further it has become an exploration in optimizing computations over a large dataset.

My hope for the repository is that we can improve the entropy-based algorithm in both time and number of guesses, and compare its performance to that of a machine learning algorithm of our choice.
